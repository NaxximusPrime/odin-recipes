    <h2>Fancy Pizza with a lot of meat and Cheese!</h2>
    <p>This is the <strong>best</strong> Pizza you will ever eat!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups bread flour, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle warm beer</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup warm water</li>        
        <li>3 tablespoons shortening</li>        
        <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>        
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>        
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>        
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>        
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>        
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste divided </li>        
        <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed</li>        
        <li>16 sticks string cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 4 cups bread flour, beer, water, shortening, yeast, brown sugar,<br>
            salt, garlic powder, and onion powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted<br>
            with a dough hook attachment; mix until combined. With the mixer running,<br>
            add remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough pulls away from the sides<br>
            of the bowl and forms into a ball, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place dough into the bowl.<br>
            Cover with a clean towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Grease 2 pizza pans with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil; dust with cornmeal.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down gently and divide into 2 equal portions. Place each portion <br>
            onto a prepared pan. Cover and let rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stretch each dough out 1 inch past the edge of the pan. <br>
            If dough shrinks back when stretched, cover and let rest for 5 more minutes before stretching again.</li>
            <li>Arrange 8 sticks cheese, ends touching, around the edge of 1 pan. <br>
            Fold overhang over cheese and press dough to seal. Repeat with the second pan.</li>
            <li>Now you can add some more cheese and put it in the stove for about 20 min at 200 degrees Celsius.</li>
            <li>Time to eat now!</li>
            
            <p>Now I am hungry and want Pizza...</p>
